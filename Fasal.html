                        Indian Farmers are the  most devoted farmers in the entire globe, working nonstop for the sake of their 
                        crops day and night. They are revered as idols in India.<br> The majority of people in India work in 
                        agriculture in some capacity, earning the 
                        country the moniker "land of farmers."
                        Our objective is to educate, instruct and<br> guide under privileged farmers so that they can 
                        fraternize their rights and not get exploited by any middleman in the agriculture industry.
                        We also aim to introduce<br> new technologies and innovations to the farmers so that they can contribute better vegetation to
                         the country and can get greater revenues
                         on their crops.In India <br>about 80 percent of rural women and 40 percent of rural men dependent on agriculture, still agriculture sector contribute only 20.19%  GDP only.
                         So here as you <br>can see, there is large rural population dependent on agriculture but still not contributing much to gdp. Why? What you think?
                          It is due to lack of awareness <br>about new policies, plans, machinery, irrigation facilities and lack of communication gap between policy maker i.e government and farmers.
            
                         So here is our small step <br>फसल pe hustle,
